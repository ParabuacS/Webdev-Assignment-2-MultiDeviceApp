# Webdev-Assignment-2-MultiDeviceApp
A backup repository for WebDev2 Assessment 2

Please note that the website is inspired by writing platforms such as Wattpad and Neobook.<br>
After looking into both those websites, I chose the color scheme of FreeWrite to try and avoid copyright issues<br>
(Wattpad uses orange, Neobook uses dark blue, FreeWrite uses dark green)<br>
Please also note that I used a bit of AI, specifically Google's Gemini, to fix a few issues I faced with flexbox and grid
in Tailwind CSS. Apart from that, I followed the syntax possibilities of Tailwind from here:<br>
https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/cheatsheet/<br>
This was given to us by our teacher, Sir Usman Ahmad, to convert css into Tailwind css. This way, I didn't need to make
a separate css file. <br>
Functionality will be explained via comment lines, the documentation, and the walkthrough video.<br>
(Total Coding Time: 10-11 hours?) I forgot how long I actually coded for, just that it was definitely over ten hours.
